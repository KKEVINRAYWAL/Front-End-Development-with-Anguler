# Lifecycle Hooks and Component communication
Presently exercising change detection in lifecycle hooks and also component communication, especially the concepts of dumb and smart components, child and parents component and how to establish cross communication between these components using `ngOnInit`. In this case =, i have two components, room and roomlist, in which room is the parent and smart component and roomlist is a dumb and child component. what i have been able to achieve is to establish communication between these components in which child component passes the data to the parent componet. Meanwhile, i have also used ngOnchanges. 
`ngOnChanges`
`ngOnInit`
`ngDoCheck`
`ngAfterContentinit`
`ngAfterConntentChecked`
`ngAfterViewInit`
`ngOnDestroy`
